# Overspeed Detection System with ESP32 and IR Module

## Overview
This project implements an overspeed detection system using an ESP32 development board and an IR module. The system measures vehicle speed based on the data received from the IR module and determines if the vehicle is overspeeding. The overspeed data is then sent to a Firebase database, which can be accessed by an authorized application used by competent authorities for monitoring and enforcement purposes.

## Features
- **Vehicle Speed Measurement:** The ESP32 receives digital data from the IR module to evaluate the speed of the vehicle passing through the detection zone.
- **Overspeed Detection:** After processing the data, the ESP32 compares the vehicle speed with predefined limits to determine if overspeeding has occurred.
- **Data Storage:** The overspeed data is sent to a Firebase database for storage and retrieval.
- **Authority Access:** Competent authorities can access the Firebase database through a dedicated application to monitor and enforce speed limits.

## Requirements
- ESP32 Development Board
- IR Module
- Firebase Account
- Arduino IDE or PlatformIO
- Mobile Application for Competent Authorities (to access Firebase data)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
2. Set up Firebase and create a new project.
3. Configure Firebase credentials in the ESP32 code.
4. Upload the code to the ESP32 board using Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.
5. Install and configure the mobile application for competent authorities to access Firebase data.

## Usage
1. Mount the IR module at the desired location for vehicle speed detection.
2. Power on the ESP32 board and ensure it's connected to the internet.
3. The ESP32 will continuously monitor vehicle speed and detect overspeeding.
4. Competent authorities can access overspeed data through the dedicated mobile application connected to the Firebase database.
